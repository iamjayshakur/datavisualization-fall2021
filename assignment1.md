## 4. Data reporting critiques

You'll use this template during the term to critique published reporting you find and to learn to think critically about data and visuals.

This is almost entirely from Alberto Cairo at the University of Miami and Pat Howe at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo.

## Clarity and accuracy

Were you able to immediately identify the central insight the reporter was trying to communicate? Answer on a 1-5 scale, with 5 being excellent and 1 being below expectations.

What was it?

Was it in the headline?

If there was a data visualization, were you able to understand how to read it? Again, use a 5-point scale with 5 = excellent
Was that the most efficient way to navigate the visualization?

Can you suggest ways to improve navigation?

Using your own knowledge and critical thinking abilities, do you think the data was accurate? 1-5, with 5 most accurate
List any areas where you question the accuracy of the data.

List sources you would suggest the reporter check with.

Did they provide a source?

Did they explain everything that needed explaining?

## Quality

Regardless of the form that the graphic/story takes, was it executed at a high degree of quality? (Rank 1-5, with five excellent.)
Explain what they did well and areas where improvements could be made.

Type and color (if piece includes graphics)

##Based on your knowledge of color and type use, did this person use type (as in typography, fonts) and color to their best purpose?

For example, did it:
Look like it all belonged together?
Draw your eye first to the most important pieces of information?
Make sense? For example, if it discussed heat, did it use the color red to communicate the degree of heat rather than, say, blue?


## Type (1-5)
Explain

## Color (1-5)
Explain


## Creativity
Did the piece use some creative elements to good effect? As in, to emphasize those areas that could draw someone in, or to add detail where needed, but not just random visual or story junk that distracts you?
How?


## Rate effectiveness on scale of 1-5.








## 5. SHORT PITCH

**CENTRAL QUESTION:** Does the composition of one's home impact or have a relationship to the poverty and crime rate? 

There is currently data surrounding homes where specifically the father is absent. 

As reported by in the New York Times in 1960 and other outlets, 5 percent of America's children entered the world without a mother and father married to each other. By 1980 it was 18 percent, by 2000 it had irsen to 33 percent, and fifteen years later the numbner reached 41 percent. 
For blacks, even during slavery when marriage for slaves was illegal, black children were mor elikely than today to be raised by both their mother and father. Economist Walter Williams has studied the census data, from 1890 to 1940 citing such. Also, the data trneds show that for black the out-of-wedlock births have gone from about 25 perecent in 1965 to 73 percent in 2015. 
For whites, this metric went from less than 5 percent to over 25 percent. And for hispanics, out-of-wedlock births have risen to 53 percent. The exponential growth and its 
disproportinate affect appears to hit the Black community more severely. A story exmaining the data and factor surrrouding this narrative and testing the valiaty of the data as well as 
what such figures mean and do these figures correlate (not necessarily cause) an increase, decrease in crime/poverty. 

**Why this story matters:** This story matters for many reasons. The statistics when isolated show that father absence is an underlying issue ignored in the mainstream that disproportionally affects Black Americans, particularly Black men. 
My goal in possibly reporting this information in relationship to poverty and crime factors specficially, is to shed light on this issue and provide a different perpsective on the recent crime surges across the country.
While the story is somewhat personal to me; Iâ€™ve learned that the more personal something is the more universal. 
Much of the conversation surrounding improving the Black community has been centered around racism. However, this direct issue is often neglected but it appears this may have more immediate effects on the Black community. 
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, 19.5 million children, more than 1 in 4, live without a father in the home. 
The data in the story if presented and shared in context and given background can serve as path forward, possibly, socially and in policymaking. 


**Potential Interviews:** I would like to potentially interview local community members who have grown up without a father and a social worker/expert who deals with these kinds of cases consistently. 
The ideal interview would be with a son or daughter who has experience with father absence (using their story as a human connection base i.e. pathos appeal). 
This would allow viewers/readers to connect emotionally while simultaneously giving them needed information.



## 6. Include at least one of the following features in either your critique or story pitch, to show you know how to use markdown:

A heading
A list or table
