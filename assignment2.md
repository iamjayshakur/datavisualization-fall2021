# Assignment 2: What's out there

## JayJuan Shakur Jones 


In my research on this topic, I am able to find data, however, I am not able to find alot of news reports or stories that contextualize the data in a graphically or visually apealing manner. There are many studies and much data out there surrounding single parent hoseholds but there are no news stories, with the exception of a few opinion pieces, that report on this data and its broader implications. This is the case on a national scale. There have been a few local stories that I found, that examined paritucalr neighborhoods but **nothing that contexualizes the data from a national standpoint or even just looking at a major U.S. city**. 




 ## 3 high-quality datasets 
 
 why the data source is trustworthy and what (if any) limitations it might have.

### 1. Census.gov 

The United States Census Bureau has great data that points out the nuance of what their data set calls "two extremes". The two extremes of fatherhood — “solo” dads who appear to raise their children by themselves and “absent” dads who appear to have little or nothing to do with parenting their children. This data set provides a general sense of the state of fatherhood in the U.S. (comparing present fathers to absent fathers) but no specific breakdown by more targeted demogrpahics (such as race). 



### 2. Pew Research Center 

The Pew Research Center presnets data that  profiles an unmarried parent. This data set/article (unlike 1 and 3) gives the general profile i.e. characteristics and general makeup of the human subjects reported in the census and NCBI's data sets. 


### 3. National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) 

This data set examines how the levels of nonresidential father involvement (over child ages 1 to 9) differ by race/ethnicity (comparing White, Black and Hispanic fathers). This data set is more targeted and hones in on father abscene by race nationally. It likes the context of the census data set. Howeverm both data sets combined or at least the census.gov data set mentione (number 1) would give this data context. (see also National Center for Education Statstics)
