# Assignment 2: What's out there

## JayJuan Shakur Jones, Ariel Gans, Julia Shapero, Caty Buchaniec


I am able to find data on my research on this topic. However, I am not able to find a lot of news reports or stories that contextualize the data in a graphically or visually appealing manner. There are a lot of studies and data about single-parent households, but there are few news stories (other than opinion pieces) that report on this data and its broader implications. This is the case on a national scale. I found a few local stories that examine particular neighborhoods, but nothing that contextualizes the data from a national standpoint or looks at a specific major U.S. city.

As for what hasn’t been done: a number of studies on the topic either control for or do not consider the household income, race, crime type, the status of the father (deceased, incarcerated, etc.), educational attainment, age of subject when father became absent, and if the subject has an immediate family member with a criminal record. It would also be interesting to compare the outcomes of children who grew up in a motherless versus fatherless household. We hope to incorporate these data points into our final project. We also hope to update recent studies on the matter, since many are over a couple of years old.




 ## 3 high-quality datasets 
 
### 1. Census.gov
The United States Census Bureau has great data that points out the nuance of what their data set calls "two extremes". The two extremes of fatherhood — “solo” dads who appear to raise their children by themselves and “absent” dads who appear to have little or nothing to do with parenting their children. This data set provides a general sense of the state of fatherhood in the U.S. (comparing present fathers to absent fathers) but no specific breakdown by more targeted demographics (such as race).

### 2. Pew Research Center
The Pew Research Center presents data that profiles an unmarried parent. This data set/article (unlike 1 and 3) gives the general profile i.e. characteristics and general makeup of the human subjects reported in the census and NCBI's data sets.

### 3. National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI)
This data set examines how the levels of nonresidential father involvement (over child ages 1 to 9) differ by race/ethnicity (comparing White, Black, and Hispanic fathers). This data set is more targeted and hones in on father absence by race nationally. It likes the context of the census data set. However, both data sets combined or at least the census.gov data set mentioned (number 1) would give this data context. (see also National Center for Education Statistics)

All of the data sets mentioned above are reputable sources such as Pew Research and the U.S. Census. They are nonpartisan and are transparent about their data collection methods and sources.
