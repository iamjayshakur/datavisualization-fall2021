# Assignment 4: Interview a dataset

A link to the dataset (which you can include in your repository), your questions, as well as the answers to those questions.

DATA {ORIGINAL} SOURCE: https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/families/children.html


### 1. Write down all steps used to clean and analyze the data, including any Excel formulas.

The data, after converting to a CSV was not as messy as it originally appeared but needed some cleaning. 

- Ensured columns align
- Review (and take note of) any outliers (large or missing numbers blank columns and/or rows)
- I created a pivot table, filtering out, the year and single mothers as well as single fathers in order, to delineate the highest and lowest numbers.  

As it concern formulas I used a simple formula e.g. =E2-F2 or (=mother's only - father's only) in order to find how many more mother's (single mother's) there were  year to year. 



## MY 3 QUESTIONS: 

- Which year (from 1960 to 2020) had the most number of single mothers? 
- Which year (from 1960 to 2020) had the least number of single mothers? 
- What is thre change overtime (comparing 1960 to 2020)
      - What factors could have possibly contirbuted to this decrease/increase? (a story question possibly) 


### 3. Write a sample headline and nut graf based on the most interesting of the three questions.

## HEADLINE: 2012 was the peak of single motherhood in the U.S., with the number dropping every year since then 


NUT GRAF:
