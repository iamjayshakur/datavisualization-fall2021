A link to the dataset (which you can include in your repository), your questions, as well as the answers to those questions.

DATA {ORIGINAL} SOURCE: https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/families/children.html


### 1. Write down all steps used to clean and analyze the data, including any Excel formulas.

The data, after converting to a CSV was not as messy as it originally appeared but needed some cleaning. 

- Ensured columns align
- Review (and take note of) any outliers (large or missing numbers blank columns and/or rows)
- I created a pivot table, filtering out, the year and single mothers as well as single fathers in order, to delineate the highest and lowest numbers.  

As it concern formulas I used a simple formula e.g. =E2-F2 or (=mother's only - father's only) in order to find how many more mother's (single mother's) there were  year to year. 



## MY 3 QUESTIONS: 

### - Which year (from 1960 to 2020) had the most number of single mothers? 

2012 is the year with the highest number of single mothers and it happens to be the last year before the number begins to decrease. 


### - Which year (from 1960 to 2020) had the least number of single mothers? 

1960 had the least number of single mothers (based on the 1960 census. 

### - What is thre change overtime (comparing 1960 to 2020)
      - What factors could have possibly contirbuted to this decrease/increase? (a story question possibly) 

There is a 10, 205 difference {increase} from 1960 to 2020. Which is about 199% increase. 


### 3. Write a sample headline and nut graf based on the most interesting of the three questions.


## HEADLINE: 
2012 was the peak of single motherhood in the U.S., with the number dropping every year since then 


## NUT GRAF: 
Though the share of U.S. children living with a single parent has been rising, accompanied by a decline in marriage rates and a rise in births outside of marriage data suggests an overall decline since in single parenthood 2012.
